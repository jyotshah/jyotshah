    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Jyot Shah — a creative soul and a software engineering graduate who thrives at the intersection of logic and artistry. I chose the world of software because I genuinely enjoy coding and continuously exploring new technologies. Beyond the screen, I find joy in art, painting, and crafts, and I bring that same passion for aesthetics and precision into my work. I'm also a self-taught pizza maker and occasional baker, which adds a unique layer to my hands-on nature. Known for being a quick learner, I embrace challenges and new concepts with enthusiasm. Whether it's building intuitive interfaces, crafting clean code, or playing tennis for a break, I'm always pushing myself to grow — personally and professionally.</p>
